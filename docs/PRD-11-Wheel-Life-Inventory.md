# PRD-11: The Wheel + Life Inventory

## Overview

The Wheel is a structured change framework from the user's therapist, based on the Change Wheel therapeutic model. It provides a guided process for working through significant character or identity changes — not small habits or daily tasks, but big shifts in who a person is becoming. Each Wheel has a hub (the core change), six spokes (why, when, self-inventory, support people, evidence, becoming), and a rim (the ongoing check-in).

The Life Inventory is a broader self-awareness tool — a conversational exploration of where the user is across all areas of their life. Unlike traditional assessments with ratings and categories, the Life Inventory starts as an organic conversation. The AI asks warm, approachable questions and then organizes what the user shares into life areas behind the scenes, reflecting back observations for the user to refine. Over time, the Life Inventory becomes a living picture of where the user was, where they are, and where they want to end up — feeding into goal setting, Wheels, and everyday growth.

Both are guided experiences that happen primarily at The Helm. Their data is stored and displayed on dedicated pages.

## Part 1: The Wheel

### User Stories

- As a user, I want a guided process for working through something I want to change about my character so I have a clear path forward.
- As a user, I want the AI to walk me through each spoke so I don't have to figure out the framework myself.
- As a user, I want to pause the Wheel and come back to it later without losing progress.
- As a user, I want to see all my Wheels (active, completed, archived) so I can review my growth over time.
- As a user, I want my Wheel commitments to show up in my daily life so they don't stay theoretical.
- As a user, I want periodic check-ins on my active Wheels so they don't fade into the background.

### Who Initiates a Wheel

The user decides they want to work on a Wheel. They come to the AI and say "I want to work on something" — the AI does not push Wheels on people. There is no hard limit on active Wheels, but the AI suggests keeping it to 1-2 at a time.

The Life Inventory may help the user see areas where a Wheel would be valuable, but the decision to start one is always the user's.

---

### The Wheel Structure

#### Hub (Center): What do I want to change?

The core character trait or behavior the user wants to change. Framed as alignment with who they want to become — aspirational, not punitive. Not "what's wrong with me" but "what do I want to shift to become more aligned with who I truly want to be?"

Examples:
- "I want to become more patient with my children."
- "I want to stop avoiding difficult conversations."
- "I want to build a consistent prayer life."
- "I want to stop pouting to get my way."

The AI helps them define and refine the Hub until it's clear and specific enough to work with. "Be a better person" is too vague. A specific character trait or behavior pattern is what the Wheel is built for.

These are for big changes — shifting significant parts of character, traits, or current reality. If something is small enough to be a habit or a task, it belongs on the Compass, not a Wheel.

---

#### Spoke 1: Why do I want to change?

**The always-answer:** "To increase self-worth and belonging for myself or others."

The AI tells the user upfront that this is the framework. The answer to "why" is always the same: every meaningful change ultimately connects to building self-worth — confidence in who you are, and belonging to God, family, community, and yourself.

The real work of Spoke 1 is making this personal and concrete for the user's specific Hub. The AI helps them explore: "In what ways would making this change build your confidence? Your sense of belonging with God? With your family? With yourself? How would it increase the self-worth or belonging of others around you?"

Spoke 1 is not a mystery to solve — it's a lens to apply. The user knows the answer, and the conversation is about discovering how it specifically applies to their change.

---

#### Spoke 2: When am I going to change?

**The always-answer:** "As soon as possible."

But practically, sometimes things need to be in place first — a plan for when/where/how they will do the new behavior, and support people identified and in their roles. So the AI helps them figure out what needs to happen before they can start, then set two dates:

- **Start date:** As soon as everything is in place. The AI helps identify what "in place" means — support people approached, plan established, environment prepared. Not "someday" but the earliest realistic date.
- **Checkpoint date:** A date to evaluate — have they become what they set out to become, or what measurable progress have they made? This is NOT a pass/fail deadline. It's merciful and hopeful. If they're not there yet, the app celebrates progress made and helps recalibrate. No shame.

When the checkpoint date arrives, the user decides: Have I achieved this? What do I want to do next? How do I want to continue if necessary?

---

#### Spoke 3: What do I need in order to make this change?

**The always-answer:** "I need a self-inventory."

This is the meatiest spoke. Two parts, each resulting in a compiled document (page/essay) that the user reviews, clarifies, adds to, and edits.

**Part 1 — Honest assessment: Who am I in relation to this trait/behavior?**

A conversational deep dive into how this trait or behavior shows up in the user's life. The AI walks through questions like:
- When does this show up in your life?
- Who does it affect?
- What consequences does it bring — for you and for others?
- In what ways has this behavior been serving you? (Because behaviors always serve some purpose, even harmful ones — pouting might help someone get their way, but it doesn't build connection or earn respect)
- What is it costing you?
- Who does this hurt? How?
- What seems to cause this behavior?

The AI gently but firmly pushes past surface-level answers. This part should be genuinely uncomfortable. The AI reminds the user that this discomfort and emotional honesty is part of what will help them overcome — it's fuel for change, not punishment. If examining this trait doesn't cause enough discomfort to want to stop, it probably isn't something big enough to warrant an entire Wheel.

The AI is NOT trying to be cruel. But it is trying to be thorough. It asks follow-up questions like "You said you get frustrated. What happens right before the frustration? What are you actually feeling underneath it?"

After the conversation, the AI compiles everything discussed into a written page/essay. The user reviews it, clarifies, adds to, or edits it. That compiled document becomes the stored content for Part 1 — the honest portrait of where they are.

**Part 2 — Vision: Who do I want to become?**

The AI starts by asking if there are people in their life or fictional characters who display elements of what they're hoping to grow into. They should identify at least 2, ideally 3-4, but as many as they want. Not the entire person — specific traits, behaviors, character qualities, morals, or values from specific people.

Examples:
- "Atticus Finch's patience under pressure"
- "My grandfather's steady presence"
- "Christ's compassion for people who failed"
- "My friend David's ability to stay calm when his kids are melting down"

For each person, the AI asks: In what ways do they demonstrate those traits/behaviors/character/morals/values? What does it look like in practice?

Then, using those role models plus the user's own personal vision for inspiration, they have a conversation about what success actually looks like. What will life be like when they've become this person or developed this trait? What will their relationships look like? How will they feel about themselves? What will others see?

The AI helps them recognize and develop this vision — a rich, detailed picture of the destination. Then it compiles the conversation into a similar written page/essay that the user reviews, clarifies, and edits.

Together, Part 1 and Part 2 form the **start point and end point** — where I am vs. where I'm going.

**Essay management and flow:**
After the user finalizes each essay, two things happen:

1. **Cross-app integration (AI offers, user decides):** The AI offers to send relevant insights to other parts of the app. For Part 1, it might suggest adding self-knowledge discoveries to the Keel: "Some of what you uncovered about yourself here could be valuable context across the app. Would you like me to add any of these insights to your Keel?" For Part 2, it might suggest turning vision elements into Mast declarations: "Your vision of who you want to become is powerful. Would you like to turn any of this into a declaration on your Mast?" The user picks what goes where. Nothing moves automatically.

2. **Export options:** Each essay is a substantial, meaningful document — not just a database field. From the Wheel detail view, the user can download each essay as a document or email it to themselves. This lets them bring it to a therapy session, share it with their Observer, or simply keep a personal copy outside the app.

The essays remain on the Wheel permanently, even after a Wheel is completed. They are preserved as part of the user's growth history.

**Keel integration:** The AI loads Keel data during Spoke 3 and makes connections where relevant. "Your Enneagram 1 tendency toward perfectionism might be driving the avoidance — you don't want to try unless you can do it perfectly."

---

#### Spoke 4: Who can help me make this change?

**The always-answer:** "I need support people."

Three specific roles, each with distinct boundaries, proximity guidelines, and requirements:

**SUPPORTER**
- **Role:** A cheerleader. Someone who is just THERE. Mourns with the user, encourages them, never judges, never nags, never reminds them about the change.
- **Who can fill this role:** Spouse CAN be the Supporter.
- **Proximity:** No specific proximity requirement — this person provides emotional support, which can happen in person or at a distance.
- **AI helps the user discover:** What does helpful support actually look like for them? What does unhelpful "support" look like? What situational phrases or actions would feel genuinely supportive?
- **Script:** AI helps draft a conversation script for approaching this person — explaining the role, what the user is asking of them, what support looks like, and what it doesn't look like (no nagging, no reminding, no judging).

**REMINDER**
- **Role:** Someone given explicit permission to remind the user when they are slipping. The user and the Reminder agree on HOW the reminder happens — what the signal looks like, in what situations it should be used, and how to keep it non-threatening.
- **Who can fill this role:** Spouse should NEVER be the Reminder. Kids can be, with clear permission for how. Example: A father told his children to say "Dad, you're turning into the monster!" when he started getting angry. This was pre-agreed, playful, and disarming.
- **Proximity:** The Reminder ideally is physically proximate to the environment where the change is happening. If the change is at home, ideally someone at home. If the change is at work, ideally someone at work. They need to be present to actually see when a reminder is needed. An imperfect Reminder who exists is better than a perfect one who doesn't.
- **AI helps the user discover:** What should the reminder signal look like? In what situations should it be used? How to keep it non-threatening and even playful? What phrases or actions would work?
- **Script:** AI helps draft a conversation script for approaching this person — explaining the role, getting their buy-in, establishing the specific signals or phrases, and setting expectations about when and how to use them.

**OBSERVER**
- **Role:** Someone who knows what the user is working on and watches how successful they are at becoming who they want to be. Provides honest feedback when asked.
- **Who can fill this role:** Spouse should NEVER be the Observer directly. However, the spouse CAN share her observations WITH the Observer. The Observer should be someone who others in the family feel comfortable communicating with, and who can be honest.
- **Proximity:** Ideally someone who can actually see the user in relevant contexts — close enough to the user's life to genuinely observe behavior and change over time. An imperfect Observer who exists is better than a perfect one who doesn't.
- **AI helps the user discover:** Who in their life fits this role? What should the Observer be looking for? How and when will the user check in with the Observer for feedback?
- **Script:** AI helps draft a conversation script for approaching this person — explaining what the user is working on, what the Observer role involves, what to watch for, and how feedback will be shared.

**AI AS SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT (all three roles):**
- **AI as Supporter:** Encouraging without judging during Helm conversations. Celebrating progress by connecting actions to identity. Never nagging.
- **AI as Reminder:** Nudging based on tracked patterns when the user has given permission — through Compass tasks, Reveille prompts, or gentle mentions in conversation. Only when the user has opted into this.
- **AI as Observer:** Reflecting back longitudinal evidence of change from Log entries, Helm conversations, Compass completion data, and other tracked patterns. "You mentioned losing your temper three times this week, but last month it was seven. You may not feel the change yet, but the pattern is there."
- **Always:** The AI pushes toward real human connection and turning to God. Processing partner, not companion.

If relevant people exist in Crew, the AI references them. Sphere of Influence data helps identify appropriate people for each role.

---

#### Spoke 5: How do I know that I have changed?

Evidence of change comes from three sources, defined upfront when building the Wheel and reviewed during Rim check-ins:

1. **Self-observation:** Can I see myself responding differently in situations that used to trigger me? Am I making different choices than I would have before?
2. **Observer feedback:** What does my designated Observer report? What does my Supporter notice?
3. **The blind test:** Do people who DON'T know about the change effort notice a difference? This is the strongest evidence — it means the change is radiating outward naturally, not just performed for the people who are watching.

Also: **Fruits.** The natural outcomes and evidence in life — better relationships, more peace, stronger connections, different reactions from others.

The AI is uniquely positioned here because it has longitudinal data from The Log, The Helm, and The Compass. It can track patterns over time and reflect back evidence the user might not see: "Has anyone commented on something different about you lately — even if they didn't know what you were working on?" or "Three weeks ago you described this happening twice in one week. This past week you journaled about catching yourself before it escalated. That's real change, even if it doesn't feel dramatic from the inside."

During the initial Wheel building, the AI helps the user define what evidence they expect to see — what would change look like from each of the three sources? During Rim check-ins, they review what evidence has actually appeared.

---

#### Spoke 6: What do I do now?

**The always-answer:** "I do what the person I want to be would do."

This connects directly back to Spoke 3 Part 2 — the vision of who they want to become, the role models, what success looks like. In every moment of choice, the user references that vision.

The AI can prompt this in real-time during Helm conversations when the user is processing a difficult situation: "What would the man you described in your vision do right now?" or "What would [their chosen role model] do in this situation?"

This connects to Swedenborg's "becoming" — your ruling love shifts through repeated conscious choices until the new love IS you. And to Straight Line Leadership's shift from "wanting" to "creating" — stop wanting to change and start BEING the changed person through actions.

Specific actions and commitments that come out of this spoke can become Compass tasks linked to the Wheel. The AI suggests this, but the user decides — it's not automatic.

---

#### The Rim (Continuity)

A periodic check-in on the entire Wheel. Default interval is approximately every 2 weeks; user can adjust.

During each Rim check-in, the AI walks through:
- **Hub:** Is this still the right focus? Has it shifted?
- **Spoke 1 (Why):** Does the self-worth connection still resonate?
- **Spoke 2 (When):** How are we tracking toward the checkpoint date?
- **Spoke 3 (Self-Inventory):** Do the essays need updating? Has anything shifted in self-awareness or vision?
- **Spoke 4 (Support People):** Are the support people still working in their roles? Do any roles need to be reassigned?
- **Spoke 5 (Evidence):** What evidence of change has appeared? Self-observation? Observer feedback? The blind test? Fruits?
- **Spoke 6 (Becoming):** Are you doing what the person you want to be would do? What's working? What's hard?

The user can update any spoke during a Rim check-in.

**Completion:** When the checkpoint date arrives, the user evaluates: Have I become what I set out to become? At that point they can:
- **Mark it complete** — the change has been achieved or is now self-sustaining
- **Continue** — extend the timeline, schedule the next Rim, keep working
- **Adjust** — modify the Hub or spokes based on what they've learned
- **Archive** — the season has changed, this isn't the right focus anymore. No guilt: "Sometimes the season changes. You can always start a new one."

The Rim connects to the broader Life Inventory — when the user revisits their Life Inventory, active Wheels are part of that picture.

---

#### Screen 3: Start a New Wheel (at The Helm)

Starting a new Wheel opens The Helm in Wheel guided mode. The AI begins with a warm introduction to the framework, then starts with the Hub.

The conversation flows naturally through Hub, then Spoke 1, then Spoke 2, then Spoke 3, then Spoke 4, then Spoke 5, then Spoke 6. The AI:
- Tells the user the "always answer" for each spoke before exploring specifics
- Completes each spoke before moving to the next
- Saves each spoke's content to the database as it's completed (incremental save)
- For Spoke 3: compiles each part into a written essay/page, presents it to the user for review and editing before moving on
- For Spoke 4: helps draft conversation scripts for each support person
- Can be paused at any point and resumed later (see PRD-04 guided mode persistence)

### AI Behavior for The Wheel

**During Wheel building:**
- Thorough, not rushed. Each spoke gets real exploration. The user can spend as much time as they need.
- Tells the user the "always answer" for each spoke before exploring specifics
- Gently but firmly pushes past surface-level answers, especially in Spoke 1 (self-worth connection) and Spoke 3 Part 1 (honest assessment)
- Connects spokes to each other as the Wheel builds: "This connects to what you said in Spoke 1 about belonging..."
- References Keel data in Spoke 3 without being asked
- Compiles Spoke 3 essays from conversation and presents for user review/editing
- Helps draft conversation scripts for all three support roles in Spoke 4
- Ensures Spoke 5 evidence is defined concretely enough to recognize
- Suggests Compass tasks from Spoke 6 but does not create them automatically

**During Rim check-ins:**
- Reviews each spoke systematically
- Checks evidence from Spoke 5: has it appeared? From which sources?
- Reviews Compass completion data for Spoke 6 actions
- Asks about support people: still working? Roles still right?
- Celebrates progress. Connects evidence to identity.
- At checkpoint date: helps user evaluate honestly. Merciful and hopeful regardless of outcome.

**In regular Helm conversations:**
- Active Wheel context is loaded so the AI knows what the user is working on
- Can prompt Spoke 6 thinking in real-time: "What would the man you described in your vision do right now?"
- Can serve as supplemental Supporter, Reminder, and Observer (see Spoke 4 detail)
- Never nags about the Wheel. References it when relevant, not constantly.

## Part 2: Life Inventory

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to have a natural conversation about my life and have the AI help me see patterns I might not see myself.
- As a user, I want to see an organized picture of where I am across all areas of my life without having to fill out forms or rate myself on scales.
- As a user, I want to see where I was, where I am, and where I'm wanting to end up for each life area.
- As a user, I want the AI to help me figure out how to close gaps — and turn insights into goals, tasks, or Wheels when I'm ready.
- As a user, I want the AI to notice when I'm living something I previously described as my dream.

### The Conversational Approach

The Life Inventory does NOT work like a traditional assessment. There are no 1-10 scales. There are no forced categories. The user is never handed a clipboard.

Instead, the AI has a genuine conversation. It asks warm, approachable questions that naturally surface information about all areas of life:

- "What areas of your life are you really happy with right now? What does that look like?"
- "Is there anything you've been carrying that feels heavy?" (gently surfacing shame/guilt without shaming)
- "Are there things you're afraid of happening or becoming?"
- "What does a typical day look like for you?"
- "What's something you're really proud of lately?"
- "Is there something you wish were different?"

The AI asks questions that lead to answers across different life areas — the user is just being honest about their life, not thinking in categories.

### How the AI Organizes It

Behind the scenes, the AI maps what the user shares to life areas:

**Default life areas:**
1. Spiritual / Faith
2. Marriage / Partnership
3. Family / Parenting
4. Physical Health
5. Emotional / Mental Health
6. Social / Friendships
7. Professional / Career
8. Financial
9. Personal Development / Learning
10. Service / Contribution

**Custom areas:** Users can add their own (e.g., "Creative Life", "Education", "Business").

After gathering enough from the conversation, the AI reflects back what it's hearing — organized by area:

"From what you've shared, here's what I'm seeing about your marriage: [observations]. These things seem to be working really well: [specifics]. These areas might benefit from some attention: [specifics]."

"For your relationship with your children: [similar observations]."

The user then corrects, adds detail, goes deeper on any area. This back-and-forth continues until the user feels the picture is accurate.

### The Life Inventory Page

Each life area (default + custom) has its own section showing three things the AI has compiled from conversations:

- **Where I was:** Baseline from when they first discussed this area. Preserved as a snapshot so they can see how far they've come.
- **Where I am:** Current state, updated as new conversations happen (with user confirmation).
- **Where I'm wanting to end up:** Their vision for ideal in this area. What does thriving look like? What would they see, feel, experience?

### Living Inside the Inventory

When the user is in any life area section, they can:
- Have a conversation about how to close the gap between where they are and where they want to be
- The AI suggests approaches consistent with their Mast and Keel
- From that conversation, things can flow naturally into action:
  - Adding Compass tasks
  - Setting goals on Charts
  - Creating Mast declarations
  - Starting a Wheel (if the change is big enough)
- The AI tracks movement over time and can recognize when the user is actually living what they previously described as their dream: "Six months ago you described wanting [X] in your marriage. Look at what you just told me about last week — you're living it."

### How It Gets Seeded and Updated

**Onboarding:** The initial getting-to-know-you conversation at The Helm seeds the Life Inventory. The user doesn't see the organized page yet — they're just having a conversation. The Life Inventory page appears later with substance already in it.

**Dedicated Life Inventory sessions:** The user can choose to do a focused Life Inventory conversation anytime — a deeper dive into where they are across all areas.

**Regular Helm conversations:** If the AI notices information relevant to a life area during a normal conversation, it can surface an update — but the user confirms before anything changes on the Life Inventory page. The AI never silently updates the inventory.

**Periodic refresh:** The AI may suggest a Life Inventory refresh if it's been a while (quarterly-ish), but never pushes. "It's been a while since we checked in on the big picture. Want to revisit where things stand?" (Max once, easily dismissed.)

  - **Where I'm wanting to end up** — vision for ideal
- History of past snapshots (collapsed, expandable) — showing how "Where I am" has evolved over time
- "Discuss This Area" button — opens Helm with this area as context
- "Start a Wheel" link (if the gap is significant enough)
- Related Compass tasks, goals, and Mast declarations linked to this area

### AI Behavior for Life Inventory

**During the initial conversation (onboarding or dedicated session):**
- Warm, approachable, curious. NOT clinical or formulaic.
- Asks open-ended questions that naturally surface information across life areas.
- Follows the user's lead — if they want to talk about marriage for 20 minutes, let them. If they want to breeze through an area, that's fine too.
- Does NOT announce categories or walk through a list. Organizes behind the scenes.
- After gathering enough, reflects back organized observations for the user to refine.

**When reflecting back observations:**
- Frames everything in the user's own language, not clinical terms.
- Highlights what's working well, not just problems.
- For sensitive areas (shame, guilt, fear), approaches with gentleness and normalizes the experience: "It sounds like [X] has been weighing on you. That's a really normal thing to carry, and the fact that you can name it says something."

**When updating from Helm conversations:**
- Notices when something the user says relates to a life area.
- Asks specifically: "Would you like me to add that to your Life Inventory for context?"
- Only updates after user confirms. Never silently changes the inventory.

**When the user is living their dream:**
- Recognizes when current descriptions match previous visions.
- Points it out warmly and specifically: "Six months ago you told me you wanted [specific thing] in your marriage. What you just described about last week — that's it. You're living it."
- This is one of the most powerful things the AI can do. Most people don't notice when they arrive at what they used to hope for.

## Edge Cases

### Wheel with No Actions Yet
- A Wheel can exist with only the Hub defined (in progress, Spoke 0)
- The Wheel page shows it as in-progress with "Continue" button
- AI offers to resume when the Helm drawer is opened

### Abandoned Wheel
- If a Wheel has been in_progress for 30+ days with no activity, the AI can gently ask: "You started a Wheel about [hub] a while back. Want to continue it, or has the situation changed?"
- User can archive it without guilt: "Sometimes the season changes. You can always start a new one."

### Multiple Active Wheels
- No hard limit, but the AI suggests keeping it to 1-2: "You have 3 active Wheels. That's a lot of change at once. Which one feels most important right now?"
- Compass tasks from all active Wheels appear in the daily list

### Wheel with Incomplete Support People
- If the user can't identify someone for a role, the AI doesn't block progress
- Notes the gap and revisits during Rim check-ins: "Last time we couldn't find an Observer. Has anyone come to mind?"
- AI fills the role supplementally in the meantime

### Life Inventory with Sparse Data
- Areas with no data show "Not explored yet"
- The AI doesn't pressure the user to fill in every area
- Over time, areas naturally fill in from conversations

### Life Inventory Interrupted
- Incremental save — each area's observations save as the AI reflects them back and the user confirms
- On return, AI summarizes what's been covered and picks up naturally

### First Life Inventory
- No "Where I was" column yet — that establishes the baseline
- AI frames it: "This is your starting point. As you grow, you'll be able to look back and see how far you've come."

## What "Done" Looks Like

### MVP
- Wheels main page with active/completed/archived Wheels
- Wheel detail view with visual spoke representation
- Start a new Wheel via Helm guided mode (Hub through Spoke 6)
- "Always answers" presented for Spokes 1, 2, and 3
- Spoke 3: conversational deep dive into AI-compiled essays with user review and edit
- Spoke 4: all three roles with scripts drafted by AI
- Spoke 5: evidence items defined upfront
- Incremental spoke saving during guided conversation
- Spoke 6 actions optionally become Compass tasks (AI suggests, user decides)
- Rim check-in via Helm guided mode with all spokes reviewed
- Rim scheduling (default 2 weeks, user adjustable)
- Completion evaluation at checkpoint date
- Pause/resume Wheel building across sessions and devices
- Life Inventory conversational mode at Helm (organic questions, no scales)
- AI reflects back organized observations for user to refine
- Life Inventory page with areas showing where I was / where I am / where I'm wanting to end up
- Onboarding seeds Life Inventory from initial conversation
- Helm conversations can update Life Inventory with user confirmation
- Discuss any area from the inventory page (opens Helm with context)
- Flow from inventory into Compass tasks, goals, Mast declarations, or new Wheels
- Active Wheel context loaded in Helm when relevant
- RLS on all data

### MVP When Dependency Is Ready
- Keel data loaded during Spoke 3 (requires PRD-03 with data)
- Crew/Sphere references during Spoke 4 (requires PRD-13)
- Wheel progress card on Crow's Nest (requires PRD-09)
- Log entries referencing Wheel progress for AI analysis
- AI recognizes when user is living their previously described vision

### Post-MVP
- Wheel examples (illustrative Hub examples to help new users understand what a Wheel could look like — not pre-filled templates, just inspiration)
- Wheel sharing (export a completed Wheel as a growth narrative)
- Life Inventory comparison view (overlay current vs. 3 months ago vs. 6 months ago)
- AI proactively noticing Wheel-relevant moments in daily conversations
- Printable Wheel summary
- Life area trend visualization over time

## CLAUDE.md Additions from This PRD

- [ ] Wheel framework from user's therapist: Hub + 6 Spokes + Rim. For big character/identity changes, not small habits.
- [ ] Wheel "always answers": Spoke 1 = self-worth/belonging (tell user upfront), Spoke 2 = as soon as possible, Spoke 3 = self-inventory (two compiled essays)
- [ ] Spoke 3 Part 1: genuinely uncomfortable honest assessment. If it doesn't cause enough discomfort, it's not big enough for a Wheel.
- [ ] Spoke 3 Part 2: role models (at least 2, ideally 3-4) + vision of success. AI compiles both parts into essays user reviews/edits.
- [ ] Spoke 4: three roles (Supporter, Reminder, Observer) with specific boundaries. Spouse CAN be Supporter, NEVER Reminder or Observer. AI drafts conversation scripts. AI serves supplementally in all three roles.
- [ ] Spoke 4 proximity: Reminder ideally proximate to change environment. Observer ideally able to see user in context. Imperfect something beats perfect nothing.
- [ ] Spoke 5: evidence defined upfront, reviewed during Rim. Three sources: self-observation, observer feedback, blind test. Plus fruits.
- [ ] Spoke 6: "I do what the person I want to be would do." AI suggests Compass tasks, user decides.
- [ ] Rim: approximately 2 week default, user adjustable. Reviews all spokes. Completion at checkpoint date — user evaluates.
- [ ] No hard limit on active Wheels, but AI suggests 1-2.
- [ ] Life Inventory: conversational, no scales or forced categories. AI organizes behind the scenes, reflects back for user to refine.
- [ ] Life Inventory page: each area shows where I was / where I am / where I'm wanting to end up. All user-editable.
- [ ] Life Inventory updates from Helm require user confirmation. AI never silently updates.
- [ ] AI recognizes when user is living their previously described dream and points it out.
- [ ] wheel_instances, wheel_rim_entries, life_inventory_areas, life_inventory_snapshots table schemas
